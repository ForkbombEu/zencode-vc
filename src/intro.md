This no-code language allows to create, request, sign and verify
verifiable credentials in JSON-LD format and conforming to W3C
standards. It can be easily understood and customized without any
programming knowledge.

A full reference is available on the [Zenroom development manual](https://dev.zenroom.org).

This manual will continue illustrating the Zencode contracts used for the particular usecase of verifiable credentials that are fully compatible with W3C VC specifications.
